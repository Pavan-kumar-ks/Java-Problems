In the below code I have practised different methods of switch case in java with an example
public class SWITCHCASE {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String day = "Monday";
        String res="";

        //SWITCH Statment using arrow which is used in java 12
        /*switch(day)
        {
            case "Sunday","Saturday"->System.out.println("Weekend");

            case "Monday"->System.out.println("First day of the week");

            default->System.out.println("WORKDAYS");
        }*/


        //SWITCH Statment as an expression
        res = switch(day)
        {
            case "Sunday","Saturday"-> "Weekend";

            case "Monday"->"First day of the week";

            default->"WORKDAYS";
        };//we need to end with a semicolon because switch is being used as an expression here

        System.out.println(res);*/

        //SWITCH Statment with colon(:) and "yield" keyword in java 12
        res = switch(day)
        {
            case "Sunday","Saturday":yield  "Weekend";

            case "Monday": yield "First day of the week";

            default : yield "WORKDAYS";
        };
        System.out.println(res);

    }
}
